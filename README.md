# GeyserHacks
Various workarounds for Geyser players that modify the server in order to achieve their goal.

Issues with each workaround are listed in the plugin's config. **Please take your time to read them as the workarounds in this plugin can be used for exploitative purposes.**

Fixes:
- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/638 by implementing the control server-side.
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1741 by adding unbreaking 1 to sweeping edge books/items if that's the only enchant. Adding the enchant gives bedrock players ability to use it in an anvil. By default, this changes name of any item with sweeping edge to reflect it's level everytime a bedrock player clicks on it in the inventory.

Supported Versions:
- 1.14.x - 1.19.x
- 1.17.x & above for pig riding
